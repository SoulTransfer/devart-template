First post, and starting with 1 week left! I'm doing this to push myself to create an idea I've had for a while -- a dynamic landscape of nature-inspired objects that interact with music. I'm going for a field of Dr. Seussian plants/trees that bounce & sway in response to microphone or mp3 input, and may explore other audio API's later on. Going to take a very iterative approach. My plan is to break things down into the following steps:

- Draw SVG lines within a defined area on the page.
- Create randomized recursive algorithm to draw connected line segments that decrease in size & increase in number at each node. Intent here is to draw something that look like plants.
- Explore HTML5 audio input API's. Connect one of these to the page and explore how it might affect the drawing of the plants.
- Explore more possibilities around audio input & how to make it look dope.
